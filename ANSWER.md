**QUESTION 1: EXPLAIN CI/CD**

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment. It is a software development approach that emphasizes the frequent and automated building, testing, and delivery of software.

Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of regularly merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository and running automated tests to detect integration issues. This ensures that all code changes are tested and validated in a timely and efficient manner.

Continuous Delivery (CD) is the process of automating the deployment of software to production environments. This includes building, testing, and deploying software changes to a staging or production environment, often with the use of tools such as containerization, virtualization, and infrastructure-as-code.

Continuous Deployment (CD) takes this a step further and automatically deploys the changes to production, without any manual intervention. This approach is typically used in environments where the deployment process is highly automated and where there is a high level of confidence in the quality of the code changes.

Together, CI/CD helps teams to accelerate the delivery of new features and improvements, reduce the risk of introducing errors into production environments, and enable more frequent releases of software.
